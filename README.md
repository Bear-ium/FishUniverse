# Required Python Version 3.12

# FishUniverse
This repository is the "universe" to the Fish Bot I have across on Discord &amp; Twitch as a Bot.



## Setup
Run these batch files in this order;
1. _SETUP.bat
2. _LAUNCH.bat

If there ever is an update to the repository run in these steps;
1. _REQUIREMENTS.bat
2. _LAUNCH.bat

Some info about each of the batch files;
- _SETUP.bat : This installs the Virtual Environment and then installs the requirements, it is essential for a first time setup to have a contained project.
- _REQUIREMENTS.bat : This only installs requirements, it checks for the Virtual Environment and if it is found it installs requirements.txt
- _LAUNCH.bat : This activates the Virtual Environment if it is found and it will launch main.py
